    Prettyz Art Studio are classes held for children whom are bound to express
    their creativity in new and innovative ways under the guidance of Preeti
    Katewa, an artist herself. Allow your children to find out who they truly
    are through the calming, yet awe-inspiring practice of art where children
    can channel their inner emotions and thoughts on a canvas to create
    something much more deeper than just a picture. 
description: Prettyz Art Studio is more than just drawing a cartoon or painting
  a picture, these art classes are about tapping into feelings and using that
  emotion to make a masterpiece from pure sentiment. Art, being the best way to
  stimulate imagination, is the prime solution for children to solve day-to-day
  problems only if done in a way as to express the intensity of the child's
  passion for it. Prettyz Art Studio makes all of these factors possible, by
  allowing children to add their own designs and personalize their work with
  their own mind. Details for classes can be seen below.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
